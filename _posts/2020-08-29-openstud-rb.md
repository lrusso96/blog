**openstud-rb** is a Ruby gem (still a draft!) for [Openstud](https://github.com/LithiumSR/openstud_driver), that is a Java Libary to obtain infos from Sapienza University's Infostud, developed by LithiumSR.

## Roadmap

The gem, far from being complete, only supports the login and the retrieval of student information.
