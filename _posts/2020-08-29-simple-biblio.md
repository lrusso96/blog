**Simple Biblio** is a very simple, yet powerful, Kotlin library to search for free ebooks.

I have used this as core library of an [Android application](https://github.com/lrusso96/simple-biblio-client), that was my project for Mobile Applications and Cloud Computing course held by prof. R. Beraldi.
